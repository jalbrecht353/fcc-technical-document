            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

        <section id="grammar_and_types" class="main-section">
            <header>Grammar and Types</header>
            <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python. JavaScript is <strong>case-sensitive</strong> and uses the <strong>Unicode</strong> character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
            <code>
                var Fr端h = "foobar";
            </code>
            <p>But, the variable fr端h is not the same as Fr端h because JavaScript is case sensitive. In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
            <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, see the detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.) It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>

        <section id="loops_and_iteration" class="main-section">
            <header>Loops and Iteration</header>
            <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
            <code>
                var step;
                for (step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
                // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
                console.log('Walking east one step');}
            </code>
            <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could be zero). The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>

        <section id="functions" class="main-section">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</p>
            <code>
                function square(number) {
                    return number * number;
                }  
            </code>

        <section id="expressions_and_operators" class="main-section">
            <header>Expressions and Operators</header>
            <p>JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assignment operators</li>
                <li>Comparison operators</li>
                <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
                <li>Bitwise operators</li>
                <li>Logical operators</li>
                <li>String operators</li>
                <li>Conditional (ternary) operator</li>
                <li>Comma operator</li>
                <li>Unary operators</li>
                <li>Relational operators</li>
            </ul>
            <p>JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:</p>

        <section id="numbers_and_dates" class="main-section">
            <header>Numbers and Dates</header>
            <p>In JavaScript, all numbers are implemented in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 (i.e. a number between -(263 -1) and 263 -1). In addition to being able to represent floating-point numbers, the number type has three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not-a-number). See also JavaScript data types and structures for context with other primitive types in JavaScript.</p>

        <section id="text_formatting" class="main-section">
            <header>Text Formatting</header>
            <p>JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values  (UTF-16 code units). Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it. You can create strings using string literals or string objects.</p>

            <header>Regular Expressions</header>
            <p>You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:</p>
